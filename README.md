# Shadow-Monarchs-Bill-Wizard
OBJECTIVE:
Create a desktop application that captures video input (from a webcam or pre-recorded video) to detect the total bill amount from invoices and and categorize the invoices based on their content. The system should use Optical Character recognition (OCR) to extract text and employ machine learning to categorize the invoice.
